Notes

changed key hover from react handler to css, due to buggyness

remember to bind methods in class components

to pass data from child to parent, pass function as prop from parent to child - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41369497/passing-a-function-with-parameters-through-props-on-reactjs

which handling event in child, must pass method with parameter via an anonymous function, if you wish to pass para - see Key: line 10

bug: after using sqrt, continuing a calc with the answer returns NaN: 
solved - evaluate method was missing update to calc prop

bug: numbers too long 
solved: using .toPrecision()

bug: digits go off screen
solution: need to display part of calc above, then have limit of digits on screen

bug: multiply single digit numbers giving floats
solution: toPrecision() conditional used on number, not string, so had no length, so auto evaluating to false see Calculator line 39

bug: after evaluate method called, freezes - used to work fine. doesn't happen with sqrt method
solution: evaulate needed to set state with toString, otherwise then trying to append strings to numbers, nothing happens because no error displayed 

bug: after evaluate next append doesnt clear display

bug: sqrt negatve num needs error message

Features:

maintains calculation separately from display, to keep accuracy behind the scenes, whilst keeping limited digits on display
